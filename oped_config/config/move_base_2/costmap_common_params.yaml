# The footprint attribute is used to indicate the geometry of the robot to the navigation stack. It is used to
# keep the right distance between the obstacles and the robot, or to find out if the robot can go through a
# door. The inflation_radius attribute is the value given to keep a minimal distance between the geometry of
# the robot and the obstacles.
