  sim_granularity: 0.025 #is the step size to take between points on a trajectory. It basically means how frequent should the points on this trajectory be examined (test if they intersect with any obstacle or not). A lower value means higher frequency, which requires more computation power. The default value of 0.025 is generally enough for turtlebot-sized mobile base
