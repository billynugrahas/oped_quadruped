Anggada - Quadruped Controller ROS Package


ANGGADA is open source development framework for quadruped robot using Dynamixel AX-12/AX-18 series . This framework is modified from champ library [*"ð“ƒ¡ CHAMP Quadruped Controller ROS Package"*](https://github.com/chvmp/champ).

Core Features:
- Fully Autonomous (using ROS navigation Stack).
- [Setup-assistant](https://github.com/chvmp/champ_setup_assistant) to configure newly built robots.
- Gazebo simulation environment.
- Lightweight C++ header-only [library](https://github.com/chvmp/libchamp) that can run on both SBC and micro-controllers.

Supported Hardware:

LIDAR:
- RPLidar A1M8
- YDLIDAR X4

IMU:
- MPU6500 - WIP
- MPU6050 - WIP

SBC:
- Raspberry Pi 3 model B+

    This should also work on Single Board Computers that support Ubuntu 18 capable of running ROS Navigation Stack and have a I2C peripheral devices capable of running IMU.

ACTUATORS:
- Dynamixel AX12

TESTED ON:
- Ubuntu 18.04 (ROS Melodic)
